# GyroPrompt

GyroPrompt is an interpreted scripting language that exists on top of Windows architecture. GyroPrompt aims to make the development of stable yet powerful console applications easy, while maintaining simple and consistent user-friendly syntax.
GyroPrompt maintains a current user manual which covers syntax in depth and even demonstrates example code snippets. Head over to the [Wiki](https://github.com/realChrisDeBon/GyroPrompt/wiki/Home---User-Manual) to read the user manual (a copy is also included with every release as a .pdf).
